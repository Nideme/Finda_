# FINDA

FINDA is a web application designed to facilitate seamless interaction between users and a language model (LLM) assistant. The assistant generates responses based on user input and can initiate web searches to provide supplementary information from Google, YouTube, and Wikipedia.

## Project Overview

FINDA aims to create a modern, user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with an LLM assistant and receive enhanced responses with relevant web search results.

## Features

### Frontend

1. **Chat Interface**
   - A modern, user-friendly chat interface with a text input field at the bottom for user messages.
   - Conversation history displayed above the input field.

2. **Assistant Instructions Input Field**
   - An input field at the top of the chat interface for users to input instructions that modify the assistant's behavior.

3. **Search Integration**
   - Google Search: Checkbox next to the user input field (checked by default) to initiate Google searches based on keywords from the LLM's response.
   - Additional Search Engines: Checkboxes for initiating searches on YouTube and Wikipedia.

### Backend

1. **Language Model Assistant Integration**
   - Groq integrated as the LLM assistant.
   - Handles user input and processes the LLM's response to identify keywords for web search.

2. **Search Initiation**
   - Initiates web searches on Google, YouTube, and Wikipedia based on selected options and keywords from the LLM response.

3. **Display Search Results**
   - Retrieves and formats search results to display them in the chat interface below the LLMâ€™s response.

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend
- Built with modern frameworks such as React.js.
- Ensures responsiveness, accessibility, performance, and security.

### Backend
- Built with Python.
- Secure handling of API requests and responses.
- Efficient keyword extraction and web search initiation.

## Installation

     ```

   - Create a `.env` file with your API keys

     ```plaintext
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=your_search_engine_id
     YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key
     ```

   - Run the backend server

     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

3. **Setup Frontend**

   - Navigate to the frontend directory

     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     ```

     ```

4. **Open the Application**

   Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to use the FINDA application.

## Usage

1. Enter your message in the chat input field at the bottom of the chat interface.
2. Optionally, provide instructions for the assistant in the top input field.
3. Select the search options (Google, YouTube, Wikipedia) as needed.
4. Press the "Send" button to receive a response from the LLM and see search results if applicable.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
